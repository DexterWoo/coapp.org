We're nearly done all the refactoring work necessary to have the CoApp package manager engine run as a Win32 service; as an added bonus, it even runs a heck of a lot faster.

As yet, we've still got a few more changes coming to Autopackage, and the embedded bootstrapper (once the service is done, it needs to bootstrap **that** correctly).

If all goes well, I think we'll be aiming for Beta2 being released around September 9th, and along with that I'm aiming to have some initial packages for a few open source projects including node.js and PHP, along with their slew of dependencies.

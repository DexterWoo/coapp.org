title: Shallow Forking Sprint Weekend!

A little close to short notice, but as we're getting close to the end of August, 
I thought we should do a sprint to get a bunch more shallow-forks done.

So for this weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday), I'm going to spend as much time 
online on IRC and Lync (and Skype if needs be) to give live assistance to anyone doing shallow forks.

As well, for every person that submits at least one shallow fork, I'll give two bonuses: 

1. **Double their points/entries earned this weekend in the final draw for the prizes.**<br><br>
2. **Let them pick one of the third-level prizes to get right away (any one item from XBox live subscription, 4000 Microsoft points, Xbox Controllers, Xbox Headsets ,Arc Keyboards, Sidewinder Keyboards, One of serveral XBox games, ... I think there is a few more things in there too!)**

So, yeah, come join us on [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#coapp) and/or on the **online conference call:**

You can dial-in or use the free Lync client:

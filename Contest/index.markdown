## Your chance to "Stick a fork in CoApp"
---------------

We're reaching a stage in the CoApp project where we can really use
the help of Windows developers to assist us in shallow forking open 
source projects as a precursor to producing actual CoApp packages for products and libraries.  

In order to spur the creation of the shallow-forks, the Outercurve Foundation is announcing a contest with the CoApp Project.

 

## The "Stick a fork in CoApp" Contest Rules
---------------

Our goal, is to shallow-fork 200 projects by the end of Summer. 

There will be a random drawing at the end of the contest period for 
each of the prizes.  

There are three ways to get your name in the drawing:

1.  **Create a shallow fork of a C/C++ open source project**

    Individual does the shallow-fork work according to the [CoApp forking Process](/Development/ShallowForking.html).<br>
    Pushes the completed forked-code to a repository on Github<br>
    Notify @fearthecowboy with a <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%2C+%40fearthecowboy%21+...">tweet</a> or <a href="https://github.com/inbox/new/fearthecowboy">message</a> of the available fork <br>
    \- @fearthecowboy reviews the submission for completeness<br>
    \- @fearthecowboy grants between 1 and 5 points based on forked project significance and degree of difficulty<br>
    
    For each point that Github ID gets one entry in the drawing.<br>
    
    
2.  **File and/or fix reproducable bug on a CoApp Project tool**

    Individual files a bug against a CoApp project <br>
    The bug is evaluated by the Project Team to ensure that it is valid, based on the following criteria:<br>
    \- Reproducible<br>
    \- Original (i.e., not a duplicate of another bug, or found previously by the test suite )<br>
    \- An actual defect or missing expected V1 feature  (i.e., not marked “as designed”, or “V2 feature”)<br>
    \- Not a pedantic or bug of triviality<br>
    
    Each accepted bug is worth one entry in the drawing<br>

    As well, fixing an accepted bug is also worth one entry in the drawing. (So, yes you can get a<br>

3.  **Fill in a documentation gap off the list**

    With this new website, we sure could use a few folks to go through some of the rough stuff
    and fill in and refine documentation.
    
    The website and documentation is in [github-flavored](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)
    [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) format; the easiest method to create new documentation
    is to add it to the [wiki](https://github.com/coapp/coapp.org/wiki).
    
    I'll start a list of pages [needed on this wiki page](https://github.com/coapp/coapp.org/wiki/Documentation-Needed)
    
    Each accepted peice of documentation is worth between 1 and 3 entries in the drawing.
    

**All entries are the discretion of @fearthecowboy.**

## When does the contest end?
--------------

Submissions will continue until the first of the following conditions is met:


1. **Seven days after the 200th shallow-fork submission**

2. **September 21st, 2011**

## What if I need help?
--------------

You can get help (either with the tools, the process or pretty much anything related to this) in 
a couple places:

1. **IRC** - The best place to start is in the #CoApp channel on IRC on irc.freenode.net ... If 
you don't have an IRC client handy you can login using the [Webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net) client in the browser.

2. **Mailing List** - The CoApp Mailing list is currently hosted on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~coapp-developers)

3. If you are desperate, you can also drop @fearthecowboy a message with a <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%2C+%40fearthecowboy%21+...">tweet</a> or <a href="https://github.com/inbox/new/fearthecowboy">message</a>on github.

# Northwest Open Source Hackathon

### What is it: 
An opportunity for Open Source Developers  to come together, and get some things done. We’re bringing folks together from different open source projects like NuGet, CoApp, and Orchard along with engineers from some Microsoft Product groups.

With the NuGet 2.5 release, NuGet now supports building Native libraries for C/C++, so we’re bringing special attention to hacking away on producing NuGet packages for as many open source projects as possible. Don’t know how to use NuGet? Come and Learn? Want to make some packages? Come on out!

Want to work on some other Open Source stuff? Cool, that works too!

Prizes, drinks, food, and whole lot of code! 

### When: 
Friday May 10th and Saturday May 11th  
10am till we drop!

### Where: 
Microsoft Campus, building 99 -- Room 1919
14820 Ne 36th St, Redmond, WA

### Who is invited:

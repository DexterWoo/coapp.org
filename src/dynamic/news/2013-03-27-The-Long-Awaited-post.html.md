Howdy!

I've been heads down working on stuff for a while now, and I'm finally to a point that I think I can safely share what's going on, just where exactly we are, and what you can now play with. I didn't expect that it would take this long to get to this point, but like my pappy says <b>"<i>life can be kinda like a mule--sometimes it does what you're expectin' for so long, you forget that sooner or later, it don't like that</i>" ... </b> 

Regardless, I think we're finally gettin' back on track.  

## Changes to the CoApp goals
A few months back, I mentioned that we were altering our goals a bit, most notably to fit inside this global community.

### Create one consistent way for developers to build and consume libraries on Windows.

### Focus really hard on developer libraries.

### Come back around to application packages 

## The complexity of Native Libraries.

### Many things to pivot on

### MSBuild - All the power in the universe...and just about as simple. 

### Distilling it all down

## Introducing the CoApp PowerShell Developer tools


## Nuget Native packages 

### Creating a NuGet Native package

### Publishing a NuGet Native package

### Consuming a Nuget Native package
